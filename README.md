# Task 07 - Stakeholder Decision Report (SU Women’s Lacrosse 2024)

## Overview
This Week 7 deliverable builds directly on prior work:
**Task 05 – Descriptive Statistics**: Established the statistical foundation using Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse 2024 season data. Produced descriptive stats, visualizations (top scorers, assists, pie charts), and tested LLMs for Q&A on the dataset and evaluated how well an LLM could interpret and analyze those stats.
**Task 06 – Deep Fake Interview**: Translated the same dataset into an AI-generated “deep fake” interview script and short video, showcasing how raw stats can be reframed as narrative with explicit ethics labeling. An AI-generated interview (fictional reporter & captain) was created with Vidnoz AI, transforming raw stats into a story.

Week 7 takes the outputs from those earlier tasks and transforms them into a stakeholder-facing decision report. The focus is not only on recommendations for coaches and athletic directors but also on ethical, legal, and fairness implications, with a reproducible process trail.

## What’s Included

### Stakeholder Report

Stakeholder_Decision_Report_with_Figures.docx – Full report with findings, recommendations, ethics, and embedded visuals.

### Data & Visuals

2024SUStats.pdf – Core dataset (season statistics).

Uploaded visuals: Attendance by Game, Goals by Game, Goal Distribution, Goals vs Assists, Top 5 Scorers.

Generated visuals: Goals by Period, Goals (Wins vs Losses), Shooting Percentage Comparison.

### Code

Task_05.ipynb – Original descriptive analysis.

### Appendices

Appendices provide full transparency into the process, including:

Data Lineage – Source, privacy considerations, and limitations.

Raw LLM Outputs – Verbatim logs of prompts and responses.

### Code – Python notebooks

Uncertainty & Fairness – Bootstrap confidence intervals, subgroup disparities, and robustness checks.

Deep Fake Interview – LLM-generated script (fictional, labeled) to illustrate narrative risks and ethical guardrails.

## Ethical Notes

**LLM Transparency**: All LLM-generated text is labeled explicitly; raw outputs are archived in /prompts/.

**Deepfake Disclosure**: Interview scripts and video were synthetic; disclaimers ensure no misattribution to real players or staff.

**Fairness**: Recommendations avoid penalizing individuals and emphasize team-level improvement.

**High-Stakes Oversight**: Personnel/scholarship decisions flagged as requiring HR/legal review.

**Data Privacy**: All stats are public and aggregated

**Transparency**: All LLM content is clearly labeled (model: GPT-4o; file references provided).

## Appendices in Detail
- **Appendix A – Data Lineage**: Source files, collection method, and scope of dataset.
- **Appendix B – LLM Prompts & Outputs**: Raw logs, scripts, and extended dialogues.
- **Appendix C – Code**: Analysis notebooks with reproducibility notes and random seeds.
