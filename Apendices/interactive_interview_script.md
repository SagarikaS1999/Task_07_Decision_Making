### Scene 1
**INTERVIEWER (on camera)**  
“Hey! We’re on campus talking SU lacrosse. Last season set a high bar, what’s the focus to level up this year?”

### Scene 2
**CAPTAIN (on camera)**  
"Two quick wins: raise our shooting percentage and sharpen clears. Our review shows that a **+5% bump in shooting** could’ve added **~35 goals** last year. That’s season-changing momentum."
---

### Scene 3
**INTERVIEWER (on camera)**  
"Thirty-five more goals sounds massive. Where do those come from?"

### Scene 4
**CAPTAIN (b-roll: shooting drills)**  
"Finishing in high‑value zones, cleaner feeds, and decision speed. We had multiple high‑efficiency scorers, tightening shot selection around that core gets us there."

---

### Scene 5
**INTERVIEWER (on camera)**  
"And speaking of efficiency, the numbers show Emma Ward converted 90% of her shots into points, and Olivia Adamson wasn’t far behind. How do you build an attack around that kind of production?"

### Scene 6
**CAPTAIN (b-roll: clears/rides)**  
"When two players are that sharp, you design sets that get them touches early. They draw slides, they force rotations, and that opens chances for everyone else. It’s contagious efficiency."

---

### Scene 7
**INTERVIEWER (on camera)**  
"Possession tells another story. Syracuse had a +8.2% shooting edge over opponents, but if the team had matched their clear percentage, you’d have logged about nine more successful clears. What’s changing to close that gap?"

### Scene 8
**CAPTAIN (b-roll: scoreboard montage)**  
"We’ve added daily ride-clear competitions in practice. Every failed clear counts on the scoreboard. That pressure translates directly to games, cleaner exits, fewer giveaways"

---

### Scene 9
**INTERVIEWER (on camera)**  
"Looking at trends, in wins, Syracuse averaged 17.3 goals, but in losses only 10.3. That’s a seven-goal swing. How do you keep production high against ranked opponents?"

### Scene 10
**CAPTAIN (b-roll: assist highlights)**  
"It starts in the first quarter. If we dictate tempo early, we don’t play catch-up. Against ranked teams the margin is tighter, so we emphasize patience on offense and valuing each possession late"

---

### Scene 11
**INTERVIEWER (on camera)**  
"Another stat caught my eye, Emma Tyrrell alone scored over 20% of the team’s total goals. Who else is stepping up to balance that load?"

### Scene 12
**CAPTAIN (b-roll: defensive drills)**  
"Our midfielders. Players like Adamson raised their scoring rate in the second half of the season. Sharing that responsibility prevents defenses from keying on one player"

---

### Scene 13
**INTERVIEWER (on camera)**  
"Defense plays its part too. Delaney Sweitzer faced an average of 15.5 shots per game. How does the team protect the crease better this year?"

### Scene 14
**CAPTAIN (on camera)**  
"It’s communication. Last season showed a clear link between ground balls and caused turnovers. We’re drilling those hustle plays — win the ground ball, flip possession, ease the load on our goalie"

---

### Scene 15
**INTERVIEWER (on camera)**  
"Let’s test the crystal ball"

### Scene 16
**CAPTAIN (on camera)**  
"If we boost our shooting by five percent, that’s about 35 more goals across the season. Pair that with sharper clears and stronger first quarters, and we’re talking May lacrosse."

---

### Scene 17
**INTERVIEWER (on camera)**  
"Bold prediction — love it. We’ll be watching."

### Scene 18
**CAPTAIN (on camera)**  
"Let’s ride. Go Orange!"
